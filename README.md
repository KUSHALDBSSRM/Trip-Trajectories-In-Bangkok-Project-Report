<h1> Trip Trajectories in Bangkok </h1>
The project seeks to identify clusters of tourists sharing similar trip destinations in Bangkok by analyzing the provided Trip Trajectories Dataset. 
Each trip is distinct, featuring a unique destination, and the objective is to discern and categorize trips that form communities based on their respective destinations. 
For instance, tourists with trip destinations to Nightclubs may constitute communities alongside those with trip destinations to Spas.
<h2> Community Detection Algorithms Implemented </h2>
Two community detection algorithms were implemented from scratch: <br>
<ol>
<li> Non-Overlapping Community Detection employing the Louvain Method. </li>
<li>Overlapping Community Detection utilizing the  Label Propagation Method.</li>
</ol>
